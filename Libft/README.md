#Description

Libft is a project that consists of re-implementing some of the Standard C Library functions and some additional ones, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the C language, memory management and library creation.

#Implementation

The library includes:
- Character checking and conversion function
- String manipulation functions
- Memory management functions
- Conversion functions
- Output functions
- Linked list manipulation functions

All functions are written in C and compiled into a static library : libft.a

Other available rules:
- make clean: removes object files
- make fclean: removes object files and the library
- make re: recompiles the library
