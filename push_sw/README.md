linked list allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

**Insertion Sort:**
Approach:


For each key in A:
If B is empty → pb
If key > max(B) → rotate to maximum
If key < min(B) → rotate to minimum
If it's in between → find a suitable interval

Insertion sort is used in situations when the list is small or nearly sorted and as a subroutine in Bucket Sort.



**Bucket sort**

**Radix Sort LSD**


Stability.  This is the ability of a sorting algorithm to preserve the relative order of equal keys in a file.
