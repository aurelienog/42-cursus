linked list allows efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.

**Insertion Sort:**
Approach:

    Choose the second element in the array and place it in order with respect to the first element.
    Choose the third element in the array and place it in order with respect to the first two elements.
    Continue this process until done.

Insertion sort is used in situations when the list is small or nearly sorted and as a subroutine in Bucket Sort.

**Bucket sort**

**Radix Sort LSD**


Stability.  This is the ability of a sorting algorithm to preserve the relative order of equal keys in a file.
