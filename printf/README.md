#Description

ft_printf is a project that consists of recode the function printf() in order to gain a deeper understanding of the C language and library creation.
ft_printf write the output to the standard output stream and under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (or arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg(3)) are converted for output.)

#Implementation

The library includes some output functions and one string manipulation function.

All functions are written in C and compiled into a static library : libftprintf.a

#Instructions

To compile the library, run :
make

Other available rules:
- make clean: removes object files
- make fclean: removes object files and the library
- make re: recompiles the library
